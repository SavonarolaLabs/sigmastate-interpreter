/** Scala specific trick to appease erasure of methods argument types.
  * Example usage:
  * def m1(l: List[Int])(implicit o: Overloaded1)
  * def m2(l: List[String])(implicit o: Overloaded2)
  * Without the implicit arguments the methods would have identical signatures
  * after erasure, which is a compilation time error.
